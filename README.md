Basic Geometries in BigQuery

Bigquery has the capability to handle geospatial data (currently in public Alpha 2018-08-23). It would be helpful to have the most basic of geometries at your disposal such as:

1. Global Hexbins at different resolutions.
1. Global Raster at different resolutions.
1. Countries, Provinces and localities (GADM).
